            <p align ="justify">
		    My name is  <b><font color="Wheat">Mohamed Naseem Mohamed.</font></b>  I passed the competitive examination 
		    in 1994 and received my first appointment at Talangaha Tamil School on February 5, 1996.</p>
		<p align ="justify">After completing my teacher training, I initially worked as a commerce teacher at Tundhuwa Muslim School. 
			In 2003, I received a transfer to Uswatun Hasana Vidyalaya. However, with the education reforms of 2006,
			IT was introduced as a mainstream subject, and I transitioned to teaching Information and Communication 
			Technology (ICT).</p>
		<p align ="justify">From a young age, I have had a strong desire to explore new developments in technology. Over the years, 
			I have pursued various computer-related courses to deepen my knowledge.</p>
		<p align ="justify">I have served as a teacher for 28 years, including 18 years as an ICT teacher since 2006. During this time, 
			I worked for 15 years at Uswatun Hasana Vidyalaya and 3 years at Muslim Ladies College. Additionally, I served as the teacher
			in charge of the computer labs at both schools.</p>
		<p align ="justify">I greatly value the Wisdom Cloud LMS program offered by the Provincial Ministry of Education, as it has 
			significantly contributed to enhancing my knowledge and skills.</p>
		<p align ="justify">Today, I am very happy with my role as an ICT teacher. I see this as a wonderful opportunity to fulfill 
			my long-held dream of working in this ever-evolving field.
