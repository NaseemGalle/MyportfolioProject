			, and I was appointed as a teacher on 5th February 1996. After completing my teacher training, I initially worked as a commerce teacher. However, with the education reforms of 2006, which introduced Information Technology as a mainstream subject, I transitioned to teaching Information and Communication Technology (ICT). From a young age, I have been passionate about exploring new advancements in technology. Over the years, I have pursued various computer-related courses to deepen my knowledge. Today, I view my role as an ICT teacher as a fantastic opportunity to fulfill my long-held dream of working in this ever-evolving field..</p>
